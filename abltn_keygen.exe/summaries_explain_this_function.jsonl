{"FUN_0040604b": "This function reads a series of digits and letters from a given pointer, and returns an integer representation of that series of digits and letters. If the first character is a minus sign, the returned value will be negative. If the first character is a zero, the next character may be an 'x' or 'X', indicating that the number is in hexadecimal format, or a digit between '1' and '7', indicating that the number is in octal format. If the number is not in hexadecimal or octal format, it is interpreted as a decimal number. If any non-digit characters are encountered before the end of the series, the function will return the value it has parsed up to that point.\n\n"}
